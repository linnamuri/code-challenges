Game Theory


There’s a game, “takeaway”, that is played by two players, using a number of stones.

The first player goes first. She can take 2, 3, or 5 stones from the pool. The second player goes next; she can also remove 2, 3, or 5 stones. The first player then goes, and so on.

If a player is unable to move (there are fewer than 2 stones), they lose.

Your Challenge
Imagine that both players have “perfect play” — that is, they always make the best possible move. Then, you can absolutely determine who would win a game with n stones.*/
