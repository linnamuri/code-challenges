// Create a while loop that continues to run while z is greater than 0. Within the while loop, log a countdown from the value of z to 1. Once you have logged the countdown, make sure you decrement z by 1. If your code is running properly, you should see: 5,4,3,2,1,4,3,2,1,3,2,1,2,1,1.



let z = 5

while(z > 0){
  for(let i = z;i > 0;i--){
    console.log(i)
  }
  // console.log(z)
  z--
}
